Try to do your part to make the code as weird looking as possible.
See samples from the source code for inspiration:


Like weird sigil art

```js
const bad = n => n <= 0 || isNaN(n);
```

or misusing keywords

```js
this.null = null; // whether the null hypothesis is pro or con
// ...
this.null = true;
```
